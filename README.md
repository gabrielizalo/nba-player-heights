# Motivation

Just a React exercise:

- Write a function that searches through NBA player heights based on user input.
- The raw data is taken from [NBA Player heights from 2008-9](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=nba_heights).
- The data is served in json format by [the endpoint](https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/).
- The app will take a single integer input, download the raw data and print a list of all pairs of players whose height
  in inches adds up to the integer input to the application.
- If no matches are found, the application will print "No matches found".
